### Description

I'm tired of using multiple tools to create a single icon with multiple image sizes inside. I found some similar tools, but not for free. So I just created my own.

I needed a tool that loads a single image and depending on the size it creates all the lower sizes with the best possible quality. It's also possible to manually change each image for all sizes before saving, the size will be adjusted automatically.
